# Rock-Paper-Scissor

Rock, Paper, Scissors (aka "Ro-Sham-Bo", janken, "Bato, Bato, Pick" and "Scissors, Paper, Stone") is a simple hand game that is played around the world, with many different names and variations.

In this app you just have to choose between these three moves, and you will see right after if you win or lose with a label that will show your points.

This was my first project in iOS Development using Swift.
